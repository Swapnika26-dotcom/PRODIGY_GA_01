Task-01: Text Generation with GPT-2
Objective
The objective of this task is to generate coherent and contextually relevant text using a pre-trained GPT-2 model. The model is fine-tuned on a custom text dataset and used to produce new text based on a user-defined prompt.

Platform
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Model Used
GPT-2 (pre-trained language model)
Technologies Used
Python
Hugging Face Transformers
PyTorch
Datasets library
Dataset
A small custom text dataset was created and used for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model. The dataset consists of simple text sentences related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Methodology
Installed required libraries in Google Colab.
Loaded the pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer.
Prepared and tokenized a custom text dataset.
Fine-tuned the GPT-2 model on the dataset.
Generated new text using a user-provided prompt.
Sample Prompt
Task-02: Image Generation using Pre-trained Model
Objective
