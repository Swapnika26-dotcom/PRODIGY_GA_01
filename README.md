Project Title
Image to Image Translation using GANs

Description
This project focuses on Image to Image Translation using Generative Adversarial Networks. The model learns to convert an input image into a corresponding target image by training on paired datasets. It demonstrates how deep learning can be used for tasks such as image enhancement, style transfer, and domain conversion.

Developed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, this project provided hands on experience with deep learning workflows, GAN architecture design, and TensorFlow implementation.

Features
Image to Image Translation using GAN
Generator and Discriminator model implementation
